# MLOps Pipeline for Retail Demand Forecasting

This project is focused on building a full end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** designed to automate the training, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models for **retail demand forecasting** in a **test environment**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform for scalable, repeatable test deployments.
- **CI/CD automation** using Jenkins to handle builds, tests, and deployments.
- Model training, evaluation, and deployment workflows.
- Notification system configured for email testing.
- Modular and production-ready architecture designed for real-world retail scenarios.

## 🏗️ Technologies Used

- **Terraform** – Infrastructure automation.
- **Jenkins** – CI/CD orchestration.
- **AWS** – Cloud services and test environment deployment.
- **Python** – Machine learning and data processing.

## 📂 Branch in Progress

Current development is happening on the [`feature/full-pipeline-setup`](https://github.com/JJGuilloryGit/mlopspipelineforretaildemand/tree/feature/full-pipeline-setup) branch.

## 📦 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JJGuilloryGit/mlopspipelineforretaildemand.git
    ```

2. Checkout the feature branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout feature/full-pipeline-setup
    ```

3. Follow the setup instructions (coming soon) for:
    - Terraform initialization.
    - Jenkins pipeline configuration.
    - Model training and deployment.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Set up base Terraform infrastructure.
- [x] Integrate Jenkins CI/CD pipelines.
- [ ] Add model training and evaluation steps.
- [ ] Implement deployment to test environment.
- [ ] Add monitoring and test notification configurations.
